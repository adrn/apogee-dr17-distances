\begin{abstract}\noindent
The \ESA{} \Gaia{} Mission has delivered an enormous amount of nearly
model-independent, geometric stellar distance information in the form
of parallax measurements.
Current stellar spectroscopic and photometric surveys deliver
good information about stars much more distant than those for which
parallaxes are precise.
Here we use geometric, photometric, and spectral information on XXX
stars from the \APOGEE{} Survey to learn a spectral prediction of
parallax (or distance, or distance modulus) that is independent of
any physical models of stars and stellar atmospheres.
We employ a very simple model structure that permits us to perform
inferences using the proper \Gaia{} likelihood function form.
This in turn permits us to use all measurements of parallax, including
low signal-to-noise measurements (and even negative parallaxes), which
dominate the information for luminous stars, and which must be deleted
in most other approaches.
The training includes a prior that forbids it from using spectral
information beyond the resolution of the \APOGEE{} spectrographs,
and a train/test split that ensures that no star's distance prediction
involves any training data coming from that same star.
We obtain and deliver a catalog of YYY distances and formal uncertainties.
We show the results of validation tests using ZZZ and WWW.
We find that the distances are not biased by more than VVV.
Because the model does not make any use of stellar models at any
stage, these distances are effectively purely geometric in origin.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

Hello World

\section{Model assumptions and requirements}

\begin{description}
\item[no physics] We use only geometry and data science, no stellar physics
  of any kind. These are purely geometric distances. This might be slightly
  violated if we select on $\log g$.
\item[\Gaia{} likelihood function] We use the \ESA{} \Gaia{}
  recommended likelihood function, which is a responsible (though obviously
  approximate) representation of the probability of the data given the
  parallaxes.
\item[use all parallaxes] If you train a model using only the positive
  parallaxes, or only the high-SNR parallaxes, you will get a biased model,
  especially near that cut. We never will do this abomination, unlike the
  other, similar projects out there!
\item[simple model] We are linear, under the hood, because linear is good enough,
  linear permits uncertainty propagation, and linear is interpretable. Don't use
  a 42-layer RELU network unless you need to, people!
\item[log space] Colors and magnitudes predict distance moduli and
  dust attenuations. So we do everything in log space, inside the
  model.
\item[good spectra and photometry] We assume that the features we use are
  good. This means that the spectral and photometric data are high enough in
  signal-to-noise that they don't mess up our regression.
\item[no spectral information at high resolution] The \APOGEE{} Spectrographs
  have spectral resolution around 22500. We don't permit the model to have any
  support at spectral resolutions higher than this.
\item[outliers] WHAT OUTLIERS DO WE REMOVE, and WHY DOESN'T THIS BIAS US?
\item[train-and-test] We don't ever self-test. That is, when a prediction is
  made for the parallax for star $n$, we never use model coefficients trained
  using, in any way, the data from star $n$.
  This ensures that, while the distances are geometric in origin, each star's
  spectrophotometric distance is created
  independently of the information we have directly on that star's
  geometric distance. This, in turn, means that the spectrophotometric distances
  we provide can be combined with the \Gaia{} parallax information to de-noise
  the \Gaia{} data in a statistically safe way.
\end{description}

\section{Data and pre-processing}

\APOGEE{} data release and subsample.

Continuum normalization, patching of missing data, low-pass filtering.

Combined-spectrum LSF information.

\ESA{} \Gaia{} data release, archive query, and cross matches.

Full contents of the rectangular feature matrix $X$.

\section{Method}

We do the correct method, given the assumptions listed above.

Aside from decisions made in the reading and munging of the data, the
only hyper-choices are: \Gaia{} parallax zeropoint, ridge parameter
$\lambda$, and number of train--test folds (2).

\section{Results and Validation}

\section{Discussion}

Summarize what we did and got.
