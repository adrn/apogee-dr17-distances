# apogee-dr17-distances

Spectrophotometric distances, without using ASPCAP stellar parameters, using
[Joaquin](https://github.com/adrn/joaquin).

## Pipeline

TBD

(old)
- Define the parent sample (1-Parent-sample.ipynb)
- PCA a subsample of the parent sample spectra as a way of assessing spectral
  similarity (2-Neighborhoods-PCA.ipynb)
